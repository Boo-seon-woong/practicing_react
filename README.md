# Practicign_React
본 리포지터리는 리액트를 중심으로 웹 개발 전반에 관한 내용을 잡다하게 공부하기 위해 만든 리포지터리입니다.
전에 이미 한번 동일한 내용으로 리포지터리를 만든 바가 있는데 로컬에서 초기 환경 세팅하고 branch 연결 과정에서 머지 충돌이 일어났고 멘탈 털려서 걍 삭제하고 다시 만듬.

git pull --rebase origin main
만약 로컬 말고 github에서 readme.md같은 파일 수정해서 로컬이랑 충돌할때는 위 명령어 입력해서 동기화시켜주자
안그러면 터미널에서 공포스러운 경고를 띄움과 함께 git push를 사용할 수 없게 된다.

branch 생성은 신중하게 하자. 머지 충돌 관리할때 대가리 아파온다

github으로 리액트 파일 호스팅 성공...... 너무 가시밭길이었다...

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
